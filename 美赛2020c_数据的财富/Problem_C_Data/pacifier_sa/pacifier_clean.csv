The first thing I noticed were snap-on nylon straps so I can attach this to a stroller.  The only thing I’ll need to keep in mind is not to overload the Ecosusi.  That wouldn’t be very hard to do because there are so many pockets to tuck things in, including two little lined containers that match the bag.  I can use one for a bottle, the other for a pacifier.  It’s one of those diaper bags that was more than likely one in which they consulted mothers on.  It has all the features I like to see in a bag.<br /><br />There are synthetic zippers, which are easier to work, and metal zipper pulls.  The hardware is a mix of metal and plastic.  The one vulnerability I see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap. The material is waterproof 600d nylon, something I see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag.  The design is new-generation stylish, but with an old-fashioned dollop of fun I like.  It’s a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone.<br /><br />The inside of the bag’s design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets ... zippered elasticized, and simple.  I definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy.  There’s a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if you’re walking around.  The Ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers, a change of clothes, snacks, and other essentials needed for a small excursion.<br /><br />I do have stroller straps I can use to hook this diaper bag on my Graco for quick access.  As I mentioned, in does have those snap on nylon straps if you don’t have one.  It does have 1-1/2” nylon straps so I can swing it over my shoulder or, if I prefer, I can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles.

3630,343148814,the first years gumdrop newborn pacifier,3.0,65.0,69.0,0.0,0.0,Shocked that this was recommended for nursing babies...,"Let's talk about the form of the GumDrop nipple itself. I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise/air swallowing/gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex.<br /><br />Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures).<br /><br />After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now.<br /><br />I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon. As you'll see in the photos, the hospital paci has a &#34;matte&#34; finish (which probably feels rougher, more like a human nipple) and the First Years is shiny and smooth.<br /><br />*photo (left to right) orange newborn GumDrop, green 3+ months First Years GumDrop, blue Nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding.

We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright/neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them! We use ours primarily in the car, but sometime around the house too. We just use a regular Avent pacifier for overnight, though, as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight (especially when very young).",2015-03-08,"The best Wubbanub out there!

I picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby. Wow was I irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago. My daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds, so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth (so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn't fit her tiny mouth, tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with) so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms I knew we had found magic. Due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life, it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend. I'm not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can't even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time, plus it's so large that it's very difficult to lose tho not impossible I promise. The only downside is that the plush portion isn't machine washable, you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically &#34;clean&#34;. However I can't imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so I can't hold that against the manufacturer. I'm a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about $6.99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping. It's still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she's miserable without one of these babies close by. She pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost ALL three during one infamous Ikea trip where she's was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since I last stocked up. I'm telling you, short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services, these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama (much like my happiness dictates my husband's sleeping arrangements).

I thought I'd like it better because it was all pink and cute but wanted to have a 2nd as a backup/ rotation. But, once I got the pink one in I really did not like it. It's not as floppy or long as this giraffe, which makes all the difference.

The pacifier was fantastic obviously but what I really loved about the wubbanub frog was that even after he weaned himself at five months he still liked to carry around and cuddle the frog. When I worked in pediatrics we were given a bunch for free in an attempt to get the hospital to sign on to purchasing them, sadly they did not but during that time I was sold. They're easy to find if dropped or in the bottom of an overpacked diaper bag and they balance on top of swaddled babies.

I don't think most people understand difference between these and something from 99 cent store. The fact is that babies feel comfortable when eating or breast feeding and using a pacifier replicates that warmth and comfort. They cant move on their own or use toys so this provides comfort and entertainment. but the bigger issue is sucking creates pressure that can damage structure of babies mouth causing crocked teeth or cross bites. So these are worth the money and that is why after a certain age you have to stop toddler from pacifier habit when they can use other toys and objects for comfort. This pacifier helps prevent dental damage from pacifier over usage. Also it states 0-6 month so after that find another pacifier size or other toys that they will enjoy. hope this is helpful if so please click the helpful link at the bottom.,2014-08-09,READ BEFORE BUYING Worth the Money I would definitely recommend these my son really liked these pacifiers.

Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth.

You can't just pop them in and expect them to stay like the bulb shaped ones. However once that latch is established I've found it is way more budge proof than the bulb shaped ones are.<br /><br />Another feature I really appreciate is that the handle is designed to sit flush against the base, making it less likely the baby will accidentally pull it out by the handle.<br /><br />The mouth piece is very soft and supple. The base is surrounded by a ring of silicone to increase comfort.<br /><br />My one week old newborn loves these (he loved the one he got at the hospital). He's had no issues with nipple confusion either. But that's also true of the standard bulb designs.",202,neu,3.18812324929972,0.5,0.00023969319271332693,0.000853419724165105

I can't express in words how happy THAT made me!<br /><br />This frog is the perfect size...not too big, but not too small either.  Washing was a breeze - I just stuck it in the washing machine with his clothes and would let it air dry.<br /><br />Another bonus, around 1 year of age, HE decided to stop using it on his own.  I'm so glad that I didn't have to go through that battle with him!  I think that kids generally don't want large items hanging out of their mouth by that age...so rather than have the trouble of getting rid of a pacifier at 2+, he has learned to self soothe without one.<br /><br />Thanks WubbaNub for making a quality product that we all enjoy!

It is very accurate. I have found that when you do not watch the instruction CD and read the directions, it will seem that this does not work.

If a kid comes in from the cold outside his skin temp will be cool thus a lower temp. Most kids with fever come in red cheeked, red ears, irritable, and lethargic plus other symptoms. I usually recheck only the fevers with a B&D digital under the tongue thermometer (which is consider the most accurate way to test). I would say that 99% of the time the two match. Confounding factors are: did the child have a cold drink after lunch before he came into the office? Is the child dehydrated? Has the child not been fed? Dehydration can raise core temp. Not eating a meal can reduce temp since metabolism is slowed due to no body fuel. Cold drinks cool down the mouth and head. Temp is dynamic and changes throughout the day with one's circadium cycle.

And once baby is old enough they can hold it and snuggle it while they use the paci part...or not. They are so soft.<br /><br />I'm also hoping that because there is an attached plush, it'll be easier to wean her off pacis when it's time.<br /><br />I wished the paci part was removable for washing and changing.

12896,294255492,binkibear original brown with jollypop pacifier newborn orange,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Not 100% Cotton as Claimed- Just be Informed!,"This bear is very cute, soft, and seems well made as a stuffed animal, however, this bear is not 100% cotton as BinkiBear claims it to be. The tag lists the filling as PP Cotton which is a tricky wording for Polypropylene filling. I've also seen some of the stuffing coming out of the seams which also confirms that it is definitely NOT cotton filled. The fiber filling is probably the recycled material part of the bear as Polypropylene is usually used to manufacture plastic beverage containers. This explains why other reviewers comment on how light & cheap this bear feels; if you've ever had a cotton filled stuffed animal then you may recall that cotton filled animals usually have a heavier feel to them while those stuffed with synthetic fibers feel more light and airy. I feel that the manufacturer has been very misleading in their description of BinkiBear since they state that BinkiBear is 100% cotton inside and out.<br /><br />The other qualm that I have with recommending this bear is that the pacifier is very hard to attach/remove. I feel like I may accidentally rip the bears arm off trying to fit the pacifier through the loop. The problem is that the loop that secures the pacifier is just a bit too short so it's a very tight fit trying to thread the pacifier through it. The problem could be easily remedied by the manufacturer by simply making the loop longer allowing more space for the pacifier to fit through or they could modify the design so that the pacifier is secured by a button, snap, or Velcro closure instead. Perhaps they don't all have this problem and we just received one with a short arm.<br /><br />Like I stated earlier the product is well constructed and the bear does wash well so if you don't care about the materials being 100% natural then maybe this bear will work OK for you (hopefully you'll find the pacifier easier to secure). If you're like me however and want something made of natural material instead of synthetic then I would recommend taking a look at the organic binkie towel dolls by Kathe Kruse. Despite my disappointments in the product my son is quite taken with binkibear so we will not be returning this bear.

Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see!

I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top!

Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these.

But it wasn't the end of the kitty...<br /><br />In the beginning, WubbaNub pacifiers were a LIFE-SAVER for us!  Our younger daughter was born with a horrific case of reflux.  It was strongly suggested by many professionals that she use a pacifier to help keep the acid from bothering her too much.  But what a pain it was to keep popping it back in ever few minutes, especially during the night (not that she was sleeping all that much--again, due to the reflux).  Duct tape was jokingly considered.<br /><br />An internet search eventually lead me to the WubbaNub website, and I found a local dealer to buy from (they weren't on Amazon back then).  She was 3 months old when she got her first kitty, and a back-up kitty followed several months later.  The rest is history.<br /><br />When she was a baby, it worked fantastically!  It wasn't too long before she learned to push the pacifier back into her own mouth and save me the trouble.  It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, but it still worked wonderfully.<br /><br />When we bought it, we had NO idea that we were getting her a friend for life.  And what a life it's had!

But after all these years, and all the LOVE it's received, I'm not surprised by the wear-and-tear.

WubbaNub (or Wubs, as he's called at our house) is a great friend and comfort for our baby. Why? Major pros:<br /><br />* Easy to grip: The feet are just big enough and round enough that she can get a solid grasp on any of them, and sometimes two at a time.<br />* Easy to hold: The little, soft body, which is filled with something slightly softer than beans, is easy for the baby to wrap an arm around, and light enough that she can lift and spin the giraffe with one determined fist.<br />* Easy for chewing: Not only are the feet satisfying for snacking, the little horns at the face make for interesting small chewy pieces against hier gums.<br />* High quality silicone pacifier: The Soothie pacifier that's attached is great, not just for the usual Soothie benefits but also because it's very sturdily attached to the giraffe's body. It can safely travel the washer and then be rinsed in hot water itself for maximum cleanliness.<br /><br />Points for debate:<br />* Doesn't always stay in her mouth longer. Yep, true -- sometimes she tugs it out. But she also seems less likely to have the whole thing drop from her grasp and fall to the floor; Wubs hits the deck much less often than the other, solo Soothies we have around the house.<br />* Longevity: We've had this in heavy rotation (daily play time probably equal to two hours) for a month, and he's showing a bit of wear.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing!

The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.    Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the bear's mouth.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the bear UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.  Third, the bear is very light.

18079,392768822,wubbanub infant pacifier - giraffe,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,TOTAL lifesaver and SUPER cute!!!,"Our little guy, now 7 months, LOVES his wubbies. He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are?

I thought it would help him learn to put it back in as well as be weighty enough to lay on his chest in just the right spot - so if he fell asleep he could pop it back in himself. And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own:<br />1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid)<br />2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work.<br />and<br />3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing. AND THAT should tell you something about how hideous these actually are. (Seriously, I am far from ambitious. I don't scrapbook, paint, or even cook anything that requires anything more then buttons on the microwave - so if you do - yours will probably be even more fantastically superior to these little nightmares)<br /><br />I have to say one nice thing though.

She then order him the Red Dog Wubba Nub and he has been using it ever since! We liked them so much I ordered the Blue Horse for his diaper bag and got Green Frog for the downstairs in my house.  There is literally a Wubba Nub everywhere and We don't leave home with out it.  Kids love the plush animal and like the other reviewer stated it keeps the pacifier in the babies mouth.

Sheesh.<br /><br />Get this one. It is inexpensive and it works. Bottom line.",179,neu,3.314351851851852,0.95,0.008652924256951102,0.03138060461747977

Using the water measure is not an exact science and has been more of a trial and error process. I say error meaning that slightly too little water (lower measurement mark) just means the 2-3 oz of chilled formula warmed in a Ventaire 6 oz bottle is only luke warm...which doesn't seem to phase my infant when she is ready for a meal. Also, if the water measurement is filled over the upper mark, the bottle is still comfortably warm for feeding. My husband and I have not had a bottle that was too cold or too hot which is one less thing to worry and fuss about when we are half asleep fumbling in the kitchen in the middle of the night to feed our newborn.<br /><br />Because of the type of bottles we use, we occasionally have formula leak out from the bottom seal during the warming process. This is easy to clean even if it gets baked a bit from the warming plate by using the bottle scrubber, dish soap, and a paper towel to wipe it up. The leak can be avoided, by the way, if you take the cap off before heating so that the pressure escapes through the top (nipple) rather than the bottom (seal) of the Ventaire bottle.<br /><br />I do not know how the warmer will perform when the baby starts to drink more each feeding. If we continue to use ready-to-feed formula which needs to be chilled I imagine we might have to warm larger bottles twice before they are ready. More likely, we will switch to powdered formula and flouridated water at room temperature which will only need one time through the warmer.<br /><br />In summary: Four stars for a good product only because I anticipate having to be flexible with it's use.",2006-02-20,"No complaints here...
