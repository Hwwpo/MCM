Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces!

Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

It's not so heavy that you won't want to use it, and it's surprisingly compact.<br /><br />You get two attachments, a concentrator nozzle, which if you've never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky.  You get a finger diffuser as well; which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz.  I've never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that I love up until now.  Normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it, but I was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser.<br /><br />I straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time I had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn't get rid of the frizz.  Now I just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when I want to blow dry it straight.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button, it has a COOL setting, I have A LOT of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain, now I can just switch it to the cool setting.

Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they’re both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that’s so that there aren’t large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair’s clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn’t give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for “pixiecurling.” For those who don’t know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by “pixiecurl” on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer’s diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn’t on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn’t being pushed away by airflow when you’re positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it’s a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that’s no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don’t use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I’m also unlikely to use hot, but it’s nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little.

It’s a little more than I’d like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don’t need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it’s still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother’s non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops’s instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.<br /><br />It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for). That dryer is magic. That and the Italiabrava by Babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market!",220,neu,3.426909090909091,1.0,0.000259000259000259,0.0008741432893620745

The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough!

I have never had any problems with my hair dryer. My hair is very fine so it gets the job done in 5 minutes. My only complaint is that it's a little loud for me cause I have a baby that takes naps all the time. Other than that it's a great basic hair dryer,nothing fancy.

I'd never heard of Xtava prior to November and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market, they really are creating products that will last.  I hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items!<br /><br />The Rimini blow dryer for starters, is a gorgeous hair dryer.  We desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now.  This definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased.<br /><br />It drys our hair so quickly.  Even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn't take much time at all until her hair is completely dry.  There are two speed settings, low and high as well as three heat settings plus the Cold Shot button.  I find that I use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most.<br /><br />I also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom.  The cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it.  It's not like REAL quiet, but it's not as loud as some hairdryers.  It really is one of the best dryer's I've used and it's definitely the best hair dryer that I've ever personally owned!!

I'm able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn't fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I'm able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn't need a hair dryer!<br /><br />If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn't look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.<br /><br />Since this is the first blow dryer I've owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It's a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years.

Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.<br /><br />Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!<br /><br />While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year!

I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!<br /><br />I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market!

I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.

7896,453645026,turbo power turbo 1500 professional hair dryer,4.0,23.0,24.0,0.0,0.0,It's a good dryer,"I have been researching hair dryers and came upon this dryer which my mother owns (and I still borrow).  I'm looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she's had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn't buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I've seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.<br /><br />My hair:<br />- Thick<br />- Coarse<br />- Long (past the middle of my back)<br />- Dominican (if that helps)<br />- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)<br />- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)<br />- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)<br /><br />What seems to be most people's hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):<br />- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)<br />- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort<br />- Thick (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I'd need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I'm rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don't know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it's not the dryer's fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you've ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn't the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don't apply to everyone. I don't like going to salons and haven't gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.<br /><br />When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone's John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don't use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can't comment on the dryer's efficacy on those things.<br /><br />PROS about this dryer:<br />- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)<br />- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)<br />- Gets very hot<br />- Strong air flow<br />- Good weight (not too heavy)<br />- Buttons are well placed (don't accidentally press anything)<br />- Long cord length (Haven't measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)<br />- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)<br />- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)<br />- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)<br />- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don't care but, may be a con for some)<br />- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it's a pro and con)<br />- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)<br />- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn't that cool, it is warm although I've only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you're looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)<br />- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)<br />- Not compact (If you're looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It's that good.)<br /><br />I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I'd prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money.

It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don't use that.<br />The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you're not tripping all over it, but there's still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.<br />This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price.",203,neu,3.4016025641025642,0.9411764705882353,0.0019501195971784206,0.007111954257460344

I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!

The time after that, it overheated again and I finally gave up on it... Its no use investing even $20 in this piece... It has only 2 heat settings without a cold shot button, doesn't work consistently every time... And if you change the voltage settings, it doesn't work properly! Cheap piece, do not invest any time and money in this!!!",231,neu,3.1259299516908214,0.8,0.0004144004144004144,0.0013141152653475758

The cord is not very long, but I find that to be a pro because it doesn't get tangled.  After all, how far from the outlet do I really need to go?",158,neu,2.968882385730212,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord. Hair dryer's length is 5 3/4 inches ( without the concentrator ) , depth 2 3/4 inches, height ( from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle ) 7 3/4 inches. Solano 3500 though much bigger than Sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound. First time I used the Sedu 4000i I was so impressed.

I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer.

It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.

The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value.

So I do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna. (Not sure why the byline says from a 12-year-old reader.)     The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually.  Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking.

The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually.  Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking.

The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.

I used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on-off switch from using the HI TEMP setting WHEN set for 220 volt input for foreign countries.  That is very typical.<br /><br />PLEASE ALSO NOTE that the Low Heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts.  From an electrical point of reference, doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power (wattage).  If the Low Heat mode at 110 volts (USA value) is 400 watts, then using this dryer in Low Heat mode at 220 volts (eg, Europe) would generate 1600 watts.  That's the way the power equation works.  That's how my current unit worked when we vacationed in Europe.  Low Heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed.<br /><br />WHAT you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts.  There is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting.<br /><br />If you want both HIGH and LOW Heat modes, buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts (and be sure it is big enough, power wise, to handle the 110 volt High Heat wattage).

The cost, beyond the purchase price of the transformer, is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in Europe....  a retired Electrical Engineer.<br /><br />PS:  Going from USA 60 Hertz (a.k.a. 60 cycles) to European 50 Hertz makes no difference for this appliance.<br /><br />PPS: None of the 220 V countries use our 110 V two prong or three prong wall plug.  Even if you don't buy the transformer,<br />  you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 V wall outlet (found with the luggage in most department stores or on<br />  Amazon under Plug Converter - but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for Europeans visiting USA).",377,neu,3.2504166666666667,0.9272727272727272,0.03062089425725789,0.10251131981006316

I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.

My hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth.  Then only 21 days after the one year warranty expired it quit.  No warning, no apparent problems, nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn't last a long time.  It just stopped working and would not start again.

I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.

She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.

It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.

When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine.

When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine.

It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I'm guessing will also help the future health of my hair.       The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I'm hoping they'll loosen up with more use.      This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer. It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.       I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings.",171,neu,3.175190476190476,1.0,0.000518000518000518,0.0016414551585880533
